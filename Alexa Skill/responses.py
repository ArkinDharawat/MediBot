Cravings or distaste for certain foods

But other new, more noticeable changes to your body are now happening. Your abdomen will expand as the baby continues to grow. And before this trimester is over, you will feel your baby beginning to move! As your body changes to make room for your growing baby, you may have:
Body aches, such as back, abdomen, groin, or thigh pain Stretch marks on your abdomen, breasts, thighs, or buttocks

third = """ You're in the home stretch! Some of the same discomforts you had in your second trimester will continue. Plus, many women find breathing difficult and notice they have to go to the bathroom even more often. This is because the baby is getting bigger and it is putting more pressure on your organs. Don't worry, your baby is fine and these problems will lessen once you give birth.
Some new body changes you might notice in the third trimester include:
Shortness of breath
Heartburn
Swelling of the ankles, fingers, and face.
Hemorrhoids
